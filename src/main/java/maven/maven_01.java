       //So this is maven first tutorial basically,
       //Maven is basically used to manage all the jar files you require for different tools you want to code with
       //Also it provides has lifecycles inside which you can directly from side-panel

        //GAV - Group ID , Artifact ID and Version ID -
        //So basically GAV should be unique for you library throughout the world
        //So that's why group ID is mostly the reverse of your domain name - (which is already unique out there)

        //Maven always look into Effective POM and not the POM file we see
        //Because it has to look into changes of itself and the ones we make
        //In intellij you can right click and go into maven and then effective_pom to see how it looks likes
